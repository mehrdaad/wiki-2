<h3 id="sec-2-1">What is MSI/MSI-X?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
A Message Signaled Interrupt is a write from the device to a special
address which causes an interrupt to be received by the CPU.
</p>

<p>
Because MSI is generated in the form of a Memory Write, all
transaction conditions, such as a Retry, Master-Abort, Target-Abort or
normal completion, are supported.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Why use MSIs?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
There are three reasons why using MSIs can give an advantage over
traditional pin-based interrupts.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MSIs are never shared
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pin-based PCI interrupts are often shared amongst several devices.
To support this, the kernel must call each interrupt handler associated
with an interrupt, which leads to reduced performance for the system as
a whole.  MSIs are never shared, so this problem cannot arise.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>avoids this problem as the interrupt-generating write cannot pass
the data writes, so by the time the interrupt is raised
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a device writes data to memory, then raises a pin-based interrupt,
it is possible that the interrupt may arrive before all the data has
arrived in memory (this becomes more likely with devices behind PCI-PCI
bridges).  In order to ensure that all the data has arrived in memory,
the interrupt handler must read a register on the device which raised
the interrupt.  PCI transaction ordering rules require that all the data
arrives in memory before the value can be returned from the register.
Using MSIs avoids this problem as the interrupt-generating write cannot
pass the data writes, so by the time the interrupt is raised, the driver
knows that all the data has arrived in memory.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MSIs, a device can support more interrupts, allowing each interrupt
to be specialised to a different purpose.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
PCI devices can only support a single pin-based interrupt per function.
Often drivers have to query the device to find out what event has
occurred, slowing down interrupt handling for the common case.  With
MSIs, a device can support more interrupts, allowing each interrupt
to be specialised to a different purpose.  One possible design gives
infrequent conditions (such as errors) their own interrupt which allows
the driver to handle the normal interrupt handling path more efficiently.
Other possible designs include giving one interrupt to each packet queue
in a network card or each port in a storage controller.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">How to use MSIs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
</div><ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-3-1" name="sec-2-3-1"></a>Include kernel support for MSIs<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
To support MSI or MSI-X, the kernel must be built with the
<code>CONFIG_PCI_MSI</code> option enabled. 
</p>

<p>
For example, on x86, you must also enable <code>X86_UP_APIC</code> or SMP in order
to see the <code>CONFIG_PCI_MSI</code> option.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-2-3-2" name="sec-2-3-2"></a><code>pci_enable_msi</code><br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
<code>int pci_enable_msi_block(struct pci_dev *dev, int count)</code>
</p>

<p>
If this function returns 0, it has succeeded in allocating at least as many
interrupts as the driver requested (it may have allocated more in order
to satisfy the power-of-two requirement).  In this case, the function
enables MSI on this device and updates dev-&gt;irq to be the lowest of
the new interrupts assigned to it.  The other interrupts assigned to
the device are in the range dev-&gt;irq to dev-&gt;irq + count - 1.
</p>

<p>
If this function returns a negative number, it indicates an error and
the driver should not attempt to request any more MSI interrupts for
this device.  If this function returns a positive number, it will be
less than 'count' and indicate the number of interrupts that could have
been allocated.  In neither case will the irq value have been
updated, nor will the device have been switched into MSI mode.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-2-3-3" name="sec-2-3-3"></a><code>pci_disable_msi</code><br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-3">
<p>
<code>void pci_disable_msi(struct pci_dev *dev)</code>
</p>

<p>
This function should be used to undo the effect of <code>pci_enable_msi()</code> or
<code>pci_enable_msi_block()</code>.  Calling it restores <code>dev-&gt;irq</code> to the pin-based
interrupt number and frees the previously allocated message signaled
interrupt(s).  The interrupt may subsequently be assigned to another
device, so drivers should not cache the value of dev-&gt;irq.
</p>

<p>
A device driver must always call <code>free_irq()</code> on the interrupt(s)
for which it has called <code>request_irq()</code> before calling this function.
Failure to do so will result in a <code>BUG_ON()</code>, the device will be left with
MSI enabled and will leak its vector.
</p>
</div>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Using MSI-X</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
The MSI-X capability is much more flexible than the MSI capability.
It supports up to 2048 interrupts, each of which can be controlled
independently.  To support this flexibility, drivers must use an array of
`struct msix<sub>entry'</sub>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #00ffff;">struct</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">msix_entry</span> {
        <span style="color: #98fb98;">u16</span>     <span style="color: #eedd82;">vector</span>; <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">kernel uses to write alloc vector </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>
        <span style="color: #98fb98;">u16</span>     <span style="color: #eedd82;">entry</span>; <span style="color: #ff7f24;">/* </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">driver uses to specify entry </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">*/</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This allows for the device to use these interrupts in a sparse fashion;
for example it could use interrupts 3 and 1027 and allocate only a
two-element array.  The driver is expected to fill in the 'entry' value
in each element of the array to indicate which entries it wants the kernel
to assign interrupts for.  It is invalid to fill in two entries with the
same number.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-4-1" name="sec-2-4-1"></a><code>pci_enable_msix</code><br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-1">
<p>
<code>int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev *dev, struct msix_entry *entries,
int nvec)</code>
</p>

<p>
Calling this function asks the PCI subsystem to allocate 'nvec' MSIs.
The 'entries' argument is a pointer to an array of msix<sub>entry</sub> structs
which should be at least 'nvec' entries in size.  On success, the
function will return 0 and the device will have been switched into
MSI-X interrupt mode.  The 'vector' elements in each entry will have
been filled in with the interrupt number.  The driver should then call
request<sub>irq</sub>() for each 'vector' that it decides to use.
</p>

<p>
If this function returns a negative number, it indicates an error and
the driver should not attempt to allocate any more MSI-X interrupts for
this device.  If it returns a positive number, it indicates the maximum
number of interrupt vectors that could have been allocated. See example
below.
</p>

<p>
A request loop to achieve that might look like:

        <span style="color: #00ffff;">while</span> (nvec &gt;= FOO_DRIVER_MINIMUM_NVEC) {

The MSI-X capability specifies a BAR and offset within that BAR for the
MSI-X Table.  This address is mapped by the PCI subsystem, and should not

<h3 id="sec-2-6">Considerations when using MSIs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
</div><ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-6-1" name="sec-2-6-1"></a>Choosing between MSI-X and MSI<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-6-1">
<p>
If your device supports both MSI-X and MSI capabilities, you should use
the MSI-X facilities in preference to the MSI facilities.  As mentioned
above, MSI-X supports any number of interrupts between 1 and 2048.
In constrast, MSI is restricted to a maximum of 32 interrupts (and
must be a power of two).  In addition, the MSI interrupt vectors must
be allocated consecutively, so the system may not be able to allocate
as many vectors for MSI as it could for MSI-X.  On some platforms, MSI
interrupts must all be targetted at the same set of CPUs whereas MSI-X
interrupts can all be targetted at different CPUs.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-2-6-2" name="sec-2-6-2"></a>Spinlocks<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-6-2">
<p>
Most device drivers have a per-device spinlock which is taken in the
interrupt handler.  With pin-based interrupts or a single MSI, it is not
necessary to disable interrupts (Linux guarantees the same interrupt will
not be re-entered).  If a device uses multiple interrupts, the driver
must disable interrupts while the lock is held. If the device sends
a different interrupt, the driver will deadlock trying to recursively
acquire the spinlock.
</p>

<p>
There are two solutions.  The first is to take the lock with
<code>spin_lock_irqsave()</code> or <code>spin_lock_irq()</code> (see
<code>Documentation/DocBook/kernel-locking)</code>.  The second is to specify
<code>IRQF_DISABLED</code> to <code>request_irq()</code> so that the kernel runs the entire
interrupt routine with interrupts disabled.
</p>

<p>
If your MSI interrupt routine does not hold the lock for the whole time
it is running, the first solution may be best. The second solution is
normally preferred as it avoids making two transitions from interrupt
disabled to enabled and back again.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
Using 'lspci -v' (as root) may show some devices with "MSI", "Message
Signalled Interrupts" or "MSI-X" capabilities.  Each of these capabilities
has an 'Enable' flag which will be followed with either "+" (enabled)
or "-" (disabled).

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-8">MSI quirks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8">
<p>
Several PCI chipsets or devices are known not to support MSIs.
The PCI stack provides three ways to disable MSIs:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>globally
</li>
<li>on all devices behind a specific bridge
</li>
<li>on a single device
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-8-1" name="sec-2-8-1"></a>Disabling MSIs globally<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-8-1">
<p>
Some host chipsets simply don't support MSIs properly.  If we're
lucky, the manufacturer knows this and has indicated it in the ACPI
FADT table.  In this case, Linux will automatically disable MSIs.
Some boards don't include this information in the table and so we have
to detect them ourselves.  The complete list of these is found near the
<code>quirk_disable_all_msi()</code> function in <code>drivers/pci/quirks.c</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a board which has problems with MSIs, you can pass pci=nomsi
on the kernel command line to disable MSIs on all devices.  It would be
in your best interests to report the problem to linux-pci@vger.kernel.org
including a full 'lspci -v' so we can add the quirks to the kernel.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="sec-2-8-2" name="sec-2-8-2"></a>Disabling MSIs below a bridge<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-8-2">
<p>
Some PCI bridges are not able to route MSIs between busses properly.
In this case, MSIs must be disabled on all devices behind the bridge.
</p>

<p>
Some bridges allow you to enable MSIs by changing some bits in their
PCI configuration space (especially the Hypertransport chipsets such
as the nVidia nForce and Serverworks HT2000).  As with host chipsets,
Linux mostly knows about them and automatically enables MSIs if it can.
If you have a bridge which Linux doesn't yet know about, you can enable
MSIs in configuration space using whatever method you know works, then
enable MSIs on that bridge by doing:
</p>

<p>
<code>echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/$bridge/msi_bus</code>
</p>

<p>
where $bridge is the PCI address of the bridge you've enabled (eg
0000:00:0e.0).
</p>

<p>
To disable MSIs, echo 0 instead of 1.  Changing this value should be
done with caution as it can break interrupt handling for all devices
below this bridge.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="sec-2-8-3" name="sec-2-8-3"></a>Disabling MSIs on a single device<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-8-3">
<p>
Some devices are known to have faulty MSI implementations.  Usually this
is handled in the individual device driver but occasionally it's necessary
to handle this with a quirk.  Some drivers have an option to disable use
of MSI.  While this is a convenient workaround for the driver author,
it is not good practise, and should not be emulated.
</p>
</div>
</li></ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-9">Finding why MSIs are disabled on a device</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
From the above three sections, you can see that there are many reasons
why MSIs may not be enabled for a given device. Your first step should
be to examine your dmesg carefully to determine whether MSIs are enabled
for your machine.  You should also check your .config to be sure you
have enabled <code>CONFIG_PCI_MSI</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then, 'lspci -t' gives the list of bridges above a device. Reading
<code>/sys/bus/pci/devices/*/msi_bus</code> will tell you whether MSI are enabled (1)
or disabled (0).  If 0 is found in any of the <code>msi_bus</code> files belonging
to bridges between the PCI root and the device, MSIs are disabled.
</p>

<p>
It is also worth checking the device driver to see whether it supports MSIs.
For example, it may contain calls to <code>pci_enable_msi()</code>, <code>pci_enable_msix()</code> or
<code>pci_enable_msi_block()</code>.
